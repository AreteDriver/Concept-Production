# TLS Concept Documentation

This folder captures design artefacts that support the TLS production concept dashboard.

- `ui-ux/tls-dashboard-design.md` – Blueprint describing personas, information architecture, and the UI layout strategy for the Streamlit application.
- `ui-ux/ar-hud-concepts.md` – Concept art brief for AR heads-up displays across Flow Driver, PPO, and FQA workflows.

Future documentation (data models, deployment runbooks, research notes) can be added alongside this structure as the project grows.
