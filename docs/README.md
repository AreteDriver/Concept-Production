# Client Concept Documentation

This folder captures design artefacts that support the Client production concept dashboard.

- `ui-ux/dashboard-design.md` – Blueprint describing personas, information architecture, and the UI layout strategy for the Streamlit application.
- `ui-ux/ar-hud-concepts.md` – Concept art brief for AR heads-up displays across Flow Driver, PPO, and FQA workflows.
- `roadmap.md` – Prioritised backlog that highlights the next improvements to implement across data, analytics, AR support, and operational readiness.

Future documentation (data models, deployment runbooks, research notes) can be added alongside this structure as the project grows.
