# Stardew Valley Recipe Learning Guide

Stardew Valley features two major recipe systems—**cooking** and **crafting**—each of which can be expanded by exploring Pelican Town, befriending villagers, and improving your skills. This guide explains every reliable way to discover new recipes, highlights high-impact unlocks, and suggests an efficient progression path for new and veteran players alike.

## Getting Started

1. **Unlock the Kitchen**
   - Upgrade the Farmhouse once (10,000g + 450 wood) to gain access to a kitchen and cooktop.
   - Alternatively, cook outdoors after crafting the **Cookout Kit** (Foraging 9, 15 wood + 10 fiber + 3 coal).
2. **Build Essential Stations**
   - Crafting happens anywhere from the crafting menu, but some recipes need dedicated stations like the **Furnace**, **Keg**, or **Loom**. Craft these early to avoid bottlenecks.
3. **Track Your Recipes**
   - Open the **Collections** tab (`Esc` → *Collections* → *Cooking*/*Crafting*) to review known recipes and required ingredients.
