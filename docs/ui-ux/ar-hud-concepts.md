# TLS AR HUD Concept Art Brief

## Purpose
Provide art direction and interaction notes for augmented reality heads-up displays that support
TLS facility teams. Each concept covers the workflows, safety requirements, and validation steps
for Flow Driver shuttles, the PPO install shop, and FQA final assurance.

## Experience principles
- **Hands-free first** – Critical information should be delivered via glanceable overlays, gestures,
  or voice prompts so associates can stay focused on vehicle handling and tooling.
- **Context aware** – HUD elements anchor to the current vehicle, bay, or staging location and
  update automatically as tasks progress.
- **Escalation ready** – Provide one-tap or voice-triggered flows for raising quality concerns,
  pausing work, or summoning support teams.

## Concept overviews
### Flow Driver shuttle
**Mission**: Move vehicles between dry dock, production, and last point of rest while maintaining
proper sequencing and safety.

**Visual anchors**
- Vehicle badge hovering over the assigned VIN or lot number.
- Route ribbon that snakes through the yard with dynamic congestion highlights.
- Drop-zone grid with colour feedback (green in-position, amber adjust, red blocked).

**Interaction beats**
1. **Pick-up** – HUD verifies VIN match, displays readiness checklist (battery, fluid status), and
   confirms the target destination.
2. **In-transit** – Lane guidance widens when approaching turns; audible prompts warn about
   pedestrian crossings or active forklifts.
3. **Set-down** – Overlay displays wheel chock reminders, photo capture frame, and requires
   confirmation of staging order.

### PPO install shop
**Mission**: Execute accessory and performance installations without rework.

**Visual anchors**
- Parts tray inventory board floating near the workstation, indicating counts and torque specs.
- Step progress tracker with icons representing wheels & tires, TRD upgrades, protective installs,
  decals, exhaust components, and cosmetic touches.
- Tool callouts that glow when the associated step is active (torque wrench settings, calibration
  devices, adhesive timers).

**Interaction beats**
1. **Wheel & tire fitment** – Display bolt pattern alignment guide, torque path animation, and
   barcode scan prompt to verify batch.
2. **TRD/performance upgrades** – Highlight fastener locations, required torque ranges, and caution
   zones for wiring harness reroutes.
3. **Protection & exterior accessories** – Provide silhouette overlays for mudflaps, skid plates,
   decals, and exhaust routing. Visual countdown supports adhesive curing windows.
4. **Cosmetic detailing** – Offer paint-safe zones, badge positioning grids, and quality photo
   capture template before release to FQA.

### FQA final assurance
**Mission**: Validate cabin, exterior, and paperwork readiness prior to logistics hand-off.

**Visual anchors**
- Interior carousel that cycles through cargo net, floor mats, document packet, and invoice checks.
- Exterior sweep arc guiding associates through tie-down pin removal and plastic clip placement.
- Logistics panel summarising outbound bay assignment, hold flags, and final sign-off status.

**Interaction beats**
1. **Cabin readiness** – HUD prompts placement verification, collects invoice barcode, and logs
   literature inclusion.
2. **Exterior finishing** – Augmented outline marks the tie-down pin locations and confirms plastic
   clips conceal exposed points. Defect logging captured via quick photo hotspot.
3. **Release** – Manifest checklist confirms shipping documents, clears outstanding holds, and
   transmits completion signal to logistics.

## Asset checklist for concept art
| Role | Scenes to illustrate | Key overlays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow Driver | Dry dock pick-up, transit routing, last point of rest staging | Vehicle badge, route ribbon, staging grid, safety alerts |
| PPO | Wheel install, TRD upgrade, exterior accessory alignment, cosmetic detailing QA | Torque/fastener prompts, inventory board, silhouette guides, adhesive timers |
| FQA | Cabin readiness, exterior finishing, paperwork release | Interior carousel, tie-down removal overlay, logistics summary panel |

## Next steps for artists
1. Translate the descriptions above into storyboard frames for each workflow beat.
2. Experiment with colour coding that differentiates required actions (bold accents) from
   informational overlays (muted neutrals).
3. Provide mockups for both day and night lighting conditions to ensure readability across shifts.
4. Collaborate with engineering to validate spatial anchoring feasibility before committing to high
   fidelity renders.
