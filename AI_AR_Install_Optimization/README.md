# AI_AR_Install_Optimization

## Overview
**AI_AR_Install_Optimization** is a research and prototype initiative exploring the integration of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Augmented Reality**, and **Lean manufacturing** principles to streamline automotive installation, inspection, and QA processes.  
This project builds upon Toyota Production System (TPS) foundations while leveraging real-time AI guidance, HoloLens visualization, and Dockerized deployment for scalability.

---

## Objectives
- Reduce install and QA cycle time through real-time AI feedback.  
- Integrate AR-assisted workflows (Microsoft HoloLens 2).  
- Create standardized installation guidance models using visual AI.  
- Enable cloud-based version control and deployment via Docker.
