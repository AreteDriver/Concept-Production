## Overview

This PR configures GitHub Copilot instructions for the Client-Concept-production-2.0 repository according to best practices. The instructions provide focused context to help Copilot generate repository-relevant suggestions.

## Changes

- Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with repository-specific guidance for development setup, coding conventions, OpenAI integration patterns, and Streamlit best practices.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude common virtualenv and editor temporary files.
- Removed an accidentally committed editor swap file.

## Benefits

- Improves Copilot suggestions for this project
- Keeps documentation focused on the Client concept and Client Production System
- Reduces noise from unrelated example/template content

## Testing

- Verified Python syntax for the repository entrypoint (docs-only change)
- No functional code modified

Resolves: #13
